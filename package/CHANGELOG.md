## 2.0.0 (2025-04-16)
3:Revamped.

Fixed my little blunder earlier.
Added toggles, which is also available in the REPO controls screen, but I went above and beyond...
In crouch and you run... You automatically end crouch.
In map and your run, automatically close map.
Want to jump? End crouch to with one button press.
Running and you stop? End your sprint.
All configurable as well...
